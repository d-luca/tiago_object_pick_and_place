# tiago_object_pick_and_place
Small project for the Intelligent Robotics course (MSc Universita' degli studi di Padova).
The solution made was capable of:
- moving the robot in a position defined by a human-node that specify which, among three
objects, has to be picked up
- making the robot recognize objects and their position exploiting a unique posetag placed
on top of each of them
- making the robot to do a picking procedure avoiding collisions with other objects present
into the environment (objects previously added to the scene)
- making the robot move in front of the correct placing surface and accomplishing the placing
procedure

The navigation module was provided by the IAS lab and therefore have not been uploaded.
